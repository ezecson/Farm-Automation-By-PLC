# Farm-Automation-By-PLC
Simatic S7-1200 was used to make a mini project of farm automation to implement the main functions of PLC S7-1200 using ladder diagram by TIA Portal V13 software.

This project aims to:
- control the temperature inside the farm.
- a periodic ventalation system.
- control the irrigation of the crop using humidity sensor.
- protect the crops form insects by pesticides. 

The following chart illustrates the program flow.

Two methods were used to connect the sensors with the PLC 
- First method
